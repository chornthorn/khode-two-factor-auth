# Changelog

## [1.4.0] - 2024-11-16

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed project from `khode-two-factor-auth` to `khode-2fa`
- Removed duplicate endpoint `isTotpConfigured` (use `getTotpStatus` instead)
- Changed all API endpoint paths to use new provider ID

### Changed
- Updated all API endpoint paths to use `khode-2fa` identifier
- Updated all documentation to reflect new provider ID
- Streamlined API by consolidating status check functionality into single endpoint

### Migration
- Update all API paths from `/khode-two-factor-auth/` to `/khode-2fa/`
- Replace `isTotpConfigured` endpoint calls with `getTotpStatus`

### Technical
- Changed PROVIDER_ID constant in KhodeResourceProviderFactory.java
- Removed redundant endpoint code from KhodeResourceService
- Updated API path references in documentation


## [1.3.0] - 2024-11-15

### Added
- Support for dual authentication methods:
  - Client credentials (service account)
  - User token authentication
- New authentication validation logic in KhodeResourceService
- Enhanced security checks for user-specific access

### Changed
- Modified authentication mechanism to accept either client credentials or user token
- Improved authorization checks with user-specific validation
- Enhanced error handling for authentication and authorization failures
- Added new standardized response codes:
  - 9: Unauthorized (Authentication required)
  - 10: Forbidden (Access denied)
- Updated all endpoints with new authentication/authorization:

### Security
- Added flexible authentication support with proper access controls
- Enhanced user access validation for non-service account requests
- Service accounts can access any user's TOTP settings
- User tokens can only access their own TOTP settings

### Documentation

### Changed
- Refactored code by moving business logic from `KhodeResourceProvider` to new `KhodeResourceService` class
- Improved code organization and separation of concerns
- Enhanced maintainability by isolating service logic from resource provider

### Added
- New `KhodeResourceService` class to handle all TOTP-related business logic

### Technical
- Simplified `KhodeResourceProvider` by delegating all business logic to service layer
- Improved error handling with centralized error management in service layer
- Better separation between API endpoint definitions and business logic implementation

## [1.2.0] - 2024-11-15

### Added
- New endpoint `/realms/{realm}/khode-two-factor-auth/totp/disable-with-validation/{user_id}` for secure TOTP disabling
- Standardized response codes across all endpoints (0-8) for better error handling
- New field "code" in all API responses for programmatic handling
- Enhanced response messages with consistent format

### Changed
- Updated all API responses to include standardized response codes:
  - 0: Success
  - 1: Invalid user ID
  - 2: Invalid code format
  - 3: TOTP not enabled
  - 4: TOTP already enabled
  - 5: Server error
  - 6: TOTP setup required
  - 7: Invalid TOTP code
  - 8: Operation failed
- Enhanced error messages with more descriptive information
- Improved response structure for better consistency

### Security
- Added validation step before TOTP disabling with new disable-with-validation endpoint
- Enhanced input validation across all endpoints

### Documentation
- Added API Response Codes reference table
- Updated all API examples with new standardized response format
- Added error handling section with example responses
- Enhanced endpoint descriptions with more detailed information

## [1.1.1] - 2024-11-14

### Changed
- Improved error handling across all endpoints
- Added comprehensive validation checks for user IDs and TOTP codes
- Introduced helper methods for better code organization and reusability
- Enhanced logging for error scenarios

### Fixed
- Improved error messages for better clarity
- Better handling of edge cases in TOTP operations

## [1.1.0] - 2024-11-13

- Added documentation for the new TOTP configuration check endpoint

### Changed
- Changed TOTP setup endpoint from `GET` to `POST` method for `/realms/{realm}/khode-two-factor-auth/totp/setup/{user_id}` to follow better security practices

### Security
- Improved security by changing TOTP setup to use POST instead of GET to prevent secret exposure in URL/logs

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Initial implementation of TOTP management REST API
- TOTP setup endpoint
- TOTP verification and enabling
- TOTP status checking
- TOTP code validation
- TOTP disabling
